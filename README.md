#Titanic Challange
##The data analysis cycle
=================

This repository is a practice of the steps one should take when applying any machine learning model to a prediction problem. They are taken from Andrew Ng's Coursera Machine Learning course.

###The Problem

Predicting whether a passenger of the Titanic survived based on basic demographic data about them

[The challenge on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted)

###Data analysis cycle


1.  Train a simple model on the training data (e.g. logistic regression) and look at score achieved on the CV set. 

2.  Plot learning curves to determine whether model has high bias or high variance. 

3.  If high bias, then add features to the data by looking at where the most errors were made in the CV set ("error analysis"). Otherwise, the model has high variance and instead look into either regularizing or removing some features.

4.  Repeat 1-3 with resulting model

###Results

|         | train | CV | test |
|---------|-------|----|------|
| alldead |       |    |      |
| model1  |       |    |      |
| model2  |       |    |      |
